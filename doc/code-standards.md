# Code standards

We are working on conforming to an agreed-upon set of code standards, which can
be found in
[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLeEQE-v3eEnEtKNG4oJ8q6a8pal9q462TTgVcodcg4/edit?pli=1#gid=0).
We have a GitHub issue
[here](https://github.com/gecko-group/gecko-admin/issues/1) for tracking work
related to this.
