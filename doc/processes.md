# Processes

This document is less philosophical, and more practical. It describes our
processes for communication, development, etc.

## Weekly check-in

We have a Slack bot that asks for a check-in on Mondays. It helps Matt get an
overview of what people are working on, and it gives you some insight into what
your colleagues are working on. It also helps you be mindful about what you'd
like to work on for the week.

## Core hours

Our core hours are roughly 10 AM to 3 PM Pacific time. Those are the hours
you're expected to be online and available, but it's not uncommon for people to
set their status to AFK (away from keyboard) for a little while if they have
something they need to do during the day. Taking a walk often helps with
development tasks, and it's good for your mental and physical health.

## Taking time off

We have a Google Calendar that shows when people are out of the metaphorical
office. We also have a Slack channel (calendar_clingen) where people post about their time off. If
you plan on taking time off, first contact your line manager with the request, then add a calendar event, then post about your
time off to the calendar_clingen Slack channel so that people know you're going to be out.

## Communication

Our primary method of communication is Slack. Quick responses are not expected.
Sometimes people are stuck in meetings, eating lunch, tending to sick kids, etc.
If you have a complicated question or need to show somebody something, it's
easier to do a quick Zoom meeting. Emails are sent for meeting invites. Most
regular meetings are done via Zoom.

## Development

We each have our own way of doing things. We're a small team, and we value
individuals and interactions over processes and tools. That being said, if you
want to know about our development workflows, or the editors we use, I'm sure
any of us would be happy to sit down and discuss these things.
