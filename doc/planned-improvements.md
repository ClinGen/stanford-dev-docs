# Planned improvements

The re-architecture mentioned in [the history doc](./history.md) was done
hastily, and we've been living with the consequences of it for a while. There
are parts of our code base held together with bubble gum and duct tape. We
intend to tidy up the crufty parts of the code base in a slow and steady
fashion. We have a
[roadmap](https://github.com/gecko-group/gecko-admin/issues/3) for our planned
improvements.
