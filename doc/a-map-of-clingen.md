# A map of ClinGen

The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) is a large organization with multiple
parts. It's supported primarily by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants.
The three main parts of ClinGen are delineated by grants:

- Baylor/Stanford are on a grant together,
- Broad/Geisinger are on a grant together, and
- UNC has its own grant.

Baylor refers to Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Stanford is our
part of ClinGen. Broad refers to the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard located
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Geisinger refers to Geisinger College of Health
Sciences located in Danville, Pennsylvania.

Each institution in ClinGen collaborates with the other institutions. We don't
yet share a code base with the other institutions. The Broad/Geisinger team has
a non-trivial amount of code available to peruse on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/clingen-data-model). I (Liam Mulhall) am not aware of
where the other institutions keep their code or if it is available to peruse.
