# Getting started at Stanford ClinGen

Welcome! We're happy to have you as part of our team. :)

Don't worry about "hitting the ground running." Slow and steady wins the race.

## How to read these docs

These docs are meant to be read sequentially by someone new to the team. They
are developer-oriented. We also have a more general onboarding guide
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1ey2LSYSoA5hJHs0ag1W9Wj-m0hR7Q6zn7Sizroijc/edit#heading=h.20tp5oonbn50).

## Your first few days

Assuming you've already got your Stanford laptop, one of the devs will schedule
a casual one-on-one meeting with you to discuss getting started. (If you don't
have your laptop yet, no worries.) Some goals you could set for yourself during
your first few days are:

- get your laptop,
- make sure you have access to your Stanford email,
- make sure you have access to the Gecko Group Slack,
- say hello to everybody in the `#general` channel on the Gecko Group Slack,
- read through these docs,
- get started on required training for Stanford, and
- review the [onboarding checklist](#onboarding-checklist) GitHub issue to see
  what else needs to be done.

Be sure to follow up on anything that needs doing, and don't be afraid to ask
questions either on Zoom or on Slack.

## Your first few weeks

A few goals you could set for yourself during your first few weeks of
development are:

- do any required training for Stanford (there will be a lot),
- get your laptop set up for development,
- maybe work on some small tickets,

One thing you could do (although you're not expected to do this) is schedule
some one-on-one time with each of the devs and the non-devs to get to know them
and ask some questions about what they work on. Feel free to ask plenty of
questions! There are no "bad" or "dumb" questions.

## Onboarding checklist

In the past we've had an informal onboarding process where we would coordinate
via Slack and get everything set up. As of May 2024, we're trying a new process
where we have a GitHub issue containing a checklist for onboarding new
developers. The checklist issue should be in the
[gecko-admin](https://github.com/gecko-group/gecko-admin) repository.
