# Culture and values

The following is supposed to give you an idea of our developer culture and
values. We don't adhere to a development methodology.

## Transparency

We are striving to foster a transparent culture where every person feels
comfortable contributing their insights. We don't want anyone to be hindered by
fear of looking dumb (FOLD). If something seems complex, we should all feel
comfortable saying so.

## Simplicity

The eternal enemy of any developer is complexity. John Ousterhout, a professor
of computer science at Stanford wrote a book called *A Philosophy of Software
Design* where he makes the case that the limiting factor in software development
is complexity. Here are the first two paragraphs of the first chapter, to give
you a taste:

> Writing computer software is one of the purest creative activities in the
> history of the human race. Programmers aren’t bound by practical limitations
> such as the laws of physics; we can create exciting virtual worlds with
> behaviors that could never exist in the real world. Programming doesn’t
> require great physical skill or coordination, like ballet or basketball. All
> programming requires is a creative mind and the ability to organize your
> thoughts. If you can visualize a system, you can probably implement it in a
> computer program.
>
> This means that the greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to
> understand the systems we are creating. As a program evolves and acquires more
> features, it becomes complicated, with subtle dependencies between its
> components. Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and
> harder for programmers to keep all of the relevant factors in their minds as
> they modify the system. This slows down development and leads to bugs, which
> slow development even more and add to its cost. Complexity increases
> inevitably over the life of any program. The larger the program, and the more
> people that work on it, the more difficult it is to manage complexity.

One of our most important jobs as developers is to mitigate complexity as we
create software. There are tried-and-true ways of doing this:

- making the code simple in the first place,
- encapsulating the code well, and
- writing automated tests.

## Curiosity

If something seems strange to you, please ask questions! Dig into crufty code.
Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.
