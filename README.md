This is a central repository that houses developer documentation with links to
other pieces of developer documentation. It's meant to provide a high-level
overview of development at ClinGen. Project-specific documentation should live
in the same repository as the code it documents.

This is living documentation. We expect you to be proactive about fixing
anything that is incorrect or outdated. Feel free to improve on anything you
deem fit. At the very least, file an issue.

- [Getting started](./doc/getting-started.md)
  - Outlines the general steps to take when you first start work here.
- [A map of ClinGen](./doc/a-map-of-clingen.md)
  - Describes the various parts of the ClinGen consortium and how Stanford
    ClinGen fits in.
- [Culture and values](./doc/culture-and-values.md)
  - Discusses the culture we are trying foster. Also discusses what we value as
    an organization.
- [Processes](./doc/processes.md)
  - Documents the processes that apply to any repository in the ClinGen
    organization.
- [History](./doc/history.md)
  - Provides a brief history of ClinGen and some extra details on this history
    of Stanford ClinGen.
- [Planned improvements](./doc/planned-improvements.md)
  - Discusses our plans for improving our code and our development processes.
- [Documentation](./doc/documentation.md)
  - Documents how we document things. (That's so meta!)
- [Code standards](./doc/code-standards.md)
  - Lists our standards for production-quality code.
- [Project-specific documentation](./doc/project-specific-documentation.md)
  - Links to the documentation for our projects.

The Markdown documents in this repository should be formatted using the `mdfmt`
script in the

repo.
